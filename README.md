# TriviaGame

In this trivia game, the objective is to choose from the multiple choice answers 1 answer to each question. At the end of the game (whether you submit the answers, or have the timer run out on you), you find out how many questions you got right and how many you got wrong.

Most of my goals for the game were successful, however there were a couple features that I ran out of time to execute.

I wanted to have an instrumental music track playing while the game was being played, which would have started once the "start button" was pressed.

The other feature was to show a message at the end of the game pertaining to how many questions were right or wrong. If the user got all 5 questions wrong, there would have been an additional text line that says "You must be a seasoned World traveler! Congratulations!" If the user got less than 50% of the questions correct, there would be a text line that appears which says, "Better luck next time."
